Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB, I developed a Full Stacl MERN application called "Memories". Memories is a MERN stack application is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events and amazing moments that happened in their lives with an image that best describes the event/moment to you, with tags, e.t.c
You can as well view and like other user's memories.
